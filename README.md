In addition to lower speeds, speed variation on the roadway is a contributing factor to roadway crashes. In Phase 1 of the present study, it reveals that speed variation on roadway sections with a work zone present is higher than that without a work zone. The safety in work zones affects both motorists driving through the work zone and construction workers. The goal of Phase 2 is to identify potential traffic control measures and examine their effectiveness in reducing speed variation in work zones.

This is a Data Management Plan of the research project, which is prepared for GRAD521 in Spring 2020.
