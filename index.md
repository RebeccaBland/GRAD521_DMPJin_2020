# Data Management Plan

## Data Description
###
### Introduction
In addition to lower speeds, speed variation on the roadway is a contributing factor to roadway crashes. In Phase 1 of the present study, it reveals that speed variation on roadway sections with a work zone present is higher than that without a work zone. The safety in work zones affects both motorists driving through the work zone and construction workers. The goal of Phase 2 is to identify potential traffic control measures and examine their effectiveness in reducing speed variation in work zones.

### Dataset Types and Methods of Collection
To do so, both qualitative and quantitative data about the implemented traffic control measures and traffic data will be collected based on observations. Six datasets are needed, they are: 1) information about traffic control measure used, including their GPS coordinates, placement date and time frames; 2) traffic sensor data, including their ID and placement information (GPS coordinates and work zone locations); 3) traffic data, which are collected by traffic sensors, including sensor IDs and information about passing vehicles (time stamps, travel speeds and vehicle lengths); and 4) text, photo, and video files that document work zone layout and conditions, and observed driver behavior changes in response to the presence of traffic control measures throughout the study.

Several portable traffic sensors will be used to collect traffic data. Handheld GPS devices and GPS trackers will be used to record the GPS coordinates of the placed traffic sensors and the implemented traffic control measures. An iPhone camera and a video camera will take photos and videos about the examined work zones and passing vehicles. Handwritten notes taken during the data collection will be documented in Word. 

### Data Analysis
Quantitative data manipulation and analysis will be completed using R software. Descriptive analysis will be conducted to examine the overall pattern of speed variation, and statistical analysis, e.g., Wilcoxon signed-rank test, will be performed to confirm whether the difference between treatments is statistically significant in speed variation reduction in work zones. 

### Data Size
It is anticipated to collect field case study data on three work zones, three days per work zones. The expected volume of data collected will be between 20 to 30 GB.

## Roles and Responsibilities

The research assistant will draft the data management plan for the PI to review and revise. The PI will be responsible to ensure the data management plan is followed throughout the course. Prior to data collection, the research assistant has to ensure all the equipment (traffic sensors, GPS loggers, video cameras, etc) are fully-charged, and calibration tests of traffic sensors are performed. The funding agency will not collect or provide any raw data. Data collection will be conducted by the PI and the research assistant, with occasional assistance from members from the PI’s research group. 

It will be the research assistant’ responsibility to be the data manager after data are collected. The research assistant will be responsible for downloading and storing any data they collected in the same location (a shared folder on the OSU drive), and making sure to format and name the files appropriately. No sensitive or confidential data will be collected for this project. 

Data analysis will be primarily performed by the research assistant, with assistant/supervision from the PI and the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). The research assistant will be responsible to document the analysis process and associated files in the shared drive. After the project is completed, the PI will be the primary researcher responsible for data archiving and preservation. 

If the research assistant has to leave the project, all the data generated will be transferred to the PI. The PI will be the main person to ensure data are organized, managed and backup properly.
